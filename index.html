    <p>This web resource is a supplementary resource to our Semantic technologies in drug discovery paper. It provides interactive views of Table 1, and Figures 3 and 4 from the paper.</p>
    <p>The methodology behind selecting these specific ontologies involved searching through literature and querying the <a href="http://data.bioontology.org/documentation" target="_blank">BioPortal API</a> to find ontologies that had the potential to be relevant to drug discovery based on their content. These ontologies were then shortlisted if they were either projects or academic papers citing their usage in drug discovery research.</p>
